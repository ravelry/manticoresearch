# FindValgrind
# --------------
#
# Find Valgrind program and includes
#
# The module defines the following variables:
#
# ::
#
#   VALGRIND_FOUND        - true if valgrind was found
#   VALGRIND_INCLUDE_DIRS - include search path
#   VALGRIND_PROGRAM      - executable (valgrind is not library, nothing to link)
