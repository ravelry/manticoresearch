# Adding a new node

To add another node to a cluster just start another node of Manticore and make sure it's accessible by other nodes in your cluster. Then use a [distributed index](../Creating_an_index/Creating_a_distributed_index/Creating_a_distributed_index.md) to connect one node with another and [replication](../Creating_a_cluster/Setting_up_replication/Setting_up_replication.md) for data safety.
