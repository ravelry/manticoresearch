Escaping characters in search queries
-------------------------------------

A list of characters which should be escaped when they are searched for in SphinxQL fulltext search queries:

.. code-block:: none

	!    "    $    '    (    )    -    /    <    @    \    ^    |    ~  


Use backslash to escape the single quote character ``'`` like in the following example.

SphinxQL query to search for occurences of ``"l'italiano"`` :

.. code-block:: none

	SELECT * FROM your_index WHERE MATCH(â€˜l\'italiano')

Use double backslash to escape all other characters.

For example, here is a query to search for occurences of ``"r&b"`` or ``"(official video)"`` :

.. code-block:: none

	SELECT * FROM your_index WHERE MATCH('r\\&b | \\(official video\\)')

Pay attention that in order to escape backslash character you should use ``"\\\\\\\\"`` syntax.

E.g., to find occurences of ``"\\ABC"``, use:

.. code-block:: none

	SELECT * FROM your_index WHERE MATCH('\\\\ABC')  
	
	
Also, if you run your queries using some programming language don't forget about a mysql escaping function 
(e.g., ``mysqli_real_escape_string`` in PHP or ``conn.escape_string`` in Python) 
to escape these characters the same way as described above.
